### Problem push in github
This is likely caused by [a new GitHub  setting](https://github.com/blog/2346-private-emails-now-more-private) that blocks command line pushes that expose your email address.

Try unchecking the "Block command line pushes that expose my email" box in your [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) and then pushing again.
